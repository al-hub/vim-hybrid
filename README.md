# vim-hybrid

Dark colorscheme for vim.

This is a fork of [scwood/vim-hybrid](https://github.com/scwood/vim-hybrid) ( from [wong/vim-hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid) ).

Use your favorite plugin manager for installation. I also like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

```VimL
call plug#begin()
Plug 'al-hub/vim-hybrid'
call plug#end()

set background=dark
colorscheme hybrid
```

after save and try, 
```
:PlugUpdate
```


I have modified a few highlight for comment, backgound to [focus the contents](https://github.com/al-hub/vim-hybrid/commit/1b41c12d4a657f7d3da559e3a3459fc14c356cda) itself.
